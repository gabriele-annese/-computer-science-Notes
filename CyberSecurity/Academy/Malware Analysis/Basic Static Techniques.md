## Hasing
Hasing in malware analysis have function similar to a finger print. But the modern malware are polymorphism so the hash calculate has not ever the same.
To calculate the hash can you use MD5 or SHA-1 algorithms.

```shell
md5sum.exe <Malware>
```

## Packed and Obfuscated Malware
Malware writers often use packing or obfuscation to make their files more difficult to detect or analyze.

**Obfuscated** programs are one whose execution the malware author has attempted to hide.


**Packed** programs are subset of obfuscated program in which are compressed and cannot be analyzed. Both techniques will severely limit your attempts to statically analyze the malware.

Malware are that is packed or obfuscated contains many strings.

> NOTE
> Packed and obfuscate code will often include at least of function **LoadLibrary** and **GetProcAddress** which are use to load and gain access to additional functions
