## Hash
md5   : `215e79eaa7b9ac16a7d2bce15c94b8de`
sha1  : `5a1b751b2b4929faec702df0719d498659e0887b`

## Architecture 

| Acrh                    | HEX        |
| ----------------------- | ---------- |
| Intel 386 (32-bit x86). | **0x014c** |
| x64 (64-bit).           | **0x8664** |
| ARM                     | **0x01c0** |
| ARM64                   | **0xaa64** |
In this case the PE is a 64-bit arch

## Strings

Using `floss` i extract all string of the PE file and analyze them.
```bash
FLOSS.exe -n 8 .\Loggy.exe > loggy_strings.txt
```

I found interesting reference for `go` so i suppose the malware was written in `Golang`. To find version of golang i use this command:

```bash
cat .\loggy_strings.txt | findstr go1.*
```

The go version used is `1.22.3`.

From the strings i filter to found the suspicious github repo reference
```bash
 cat .\loggy_strings.txt | findstr github.com/*/* >> sus_github_references.txt
```

and i founded the `github.com/jlaffaye/ftp` reference. This repo could be used to perform a data exfiltration.

Another suspicious repo is `github.com/kbinani/screenshot` could be used to preform screenshot.

## Import Table
Of the import table i notice the are some suspicious functions. I think the loggy.exe use `code injection` technique to inject code in a new process.
