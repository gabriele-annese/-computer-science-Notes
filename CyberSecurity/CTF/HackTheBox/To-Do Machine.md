    - **Reason**: Great for understanding how to exploit network monitoring systems and learn SNMP enumeration.

### **Tips for Progressing**

- **Start Simple**: Begin with the beginner machines listed and try to fully understand each step of the exploitation process (enumeration, vulnerability discovery, exploitation, and privilege escalation).
- **Use Write-ups and Walkthroughs**: For the first few machines, it's useful to look at walkthroughs after you've given it a try. Over time, try to solve machines on your own before referencing solutions.
- **Join a Community**: Engage with HTB forums or the InfoSec community on Discord/Reddit to ask questions, share progress, and learn from others.
- **Document Your Work**: Keep detailed notes on how you exploit each machine. It will help when you revisit similar vulnerabilities in the future.

By tackling the machines in this list, youâ€™ll start to build a solid foundation in key areas of penetration testing. Enjoy the challenge and keep improving!
