There are various techniques to hide the malicious file. One of that is use various encryption algorithms to conceal the malicious code making it more difficult for security solutions to detect the activity of the file.

## Encryption Pros and Cons

| Evade signature-based detection | More data that's ecrypted within file the higher its entropy.Having a file with a high [entropy](https://practicalsecurityanalytics.com/file-entropy/) score can cause security solutions to flag the file or at the very least consider it suspicious and place additional scrutiny on it. |

## Encryption Types

The upcoming modules will go through three of the most widely used encryption algorithms in malware development:

- XOR
- AES
- RC4
