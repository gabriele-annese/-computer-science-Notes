Active Directory (AD) is a directory service for Windows network environment. Its a distributed hierarchical structure that allow for centralized management of organization's resources. AD provides authentication and authorization functions within Windows domain environment. 

AD it's essentially a read-only database accessible to all users within domain, regardless of their privilege level.


## Structure of AD Network

*Active Directory Domain Service* (AD DS) store information about username password and manage the rights needed for authentication. 

> Note
> By default the settings are not secure specially for bug network

AD user without privilege can be enumerate the most majority objects:


| Domain Computers         | Domain Users                |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Domain Group Information | Organizational Units (OUs)  |
| Default Domain Policy    | Functional Domain Levels    |
| Password Policy          | Group Policy Objects (GPOs) |
| Domain Trusts            | Access Control Lists (ACLs) |


### Forest
The forest in AD is the containers of AD domains. Each AD domains can be have sub-domains. A domain is a structure within which contained objects (users, computers, and groups) are accessible.

Example of simple AD network.

```shell-session
INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/
├── ADMIN.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
│   ├── GPOs
│   └── OU
│       └── EMPLOYEES
│           ├── COMPUTERS
│           │   └── FILE01
│           ├── GROUPS
│           │   └── HQ Staff
│           └── USERS
│               └── barbara.jones
├── CORP.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
└── DEV.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
```

`INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` is the root domain and contains the sub-domains `ADMIN.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` `CORP.INLANEFREIGHT`.LOCAL and `DEV.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`.

### Trust relationship
It is typically see multiple domains (or forests) linked together via trust relationship in a organizations that perform a lot of acquisitions. Its often quicker and easier to create all new users in the current domain. This can be introduce a slew security problems if not appropriately administrated

This is a example how two forest are 
![[Pasted image 20250308115811.png]]

`INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` and `FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL` have a trust relationship, meaning that users in the `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` can be access resources in the forest `FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL` and vice versa.

## AD Terminology

### Objects
an object is ANY resources in the AD environment such as OUs, printers, users, domain controllers, etc.

### Attributes
Every objects in AD env has an associated [attributes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/attributes-all) used to define a characteristic of the given object. A computer object contains attributes such as the hostname and DNS name. All attributes in AD have an associated *LDAP* name that can be use to perform *LDAP queries*, such as `displayName` for `Full Name` and `given name` for `First Name`.

### Schema
The [Schema](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/schema) is a *blueprint* of any enterprise environment. It defines what types of objects can exists in the AD database and their associated attributes. For example users in AD belong to the class "user" and computer object to class "computer". Each object has its own information (some required to be set and other optional) that are stored in Attributes. When a object is created from class this call *installation* , and object created from a specific class this called *instance*. For example if we take the computer *RDS01* this computer is a *instance* of *computer* class.

### Domain
a Domain is a logical group of object such OUs, computers, users, groups, etc. Domains can *operate entirely* independently of another or be connected via *trust relationship*.

### Forest
A forest is a collection of Active Directory domains. It is the topmost container and contains all of the AD objects introduced below, including but not limited to domains, users, groups, computers, and Group Policy objects. *A forest can contain one or multiple domains and be thought of as a state in the US or a country within the EU*. Each forest operates independently but may have various trust relationships with other forests.

### Tree
A tree is a collection of Active Directory domains that begins at a single root domain. A forest is a collection of AD trees. Each domain in a tree shares a boundary with the other domains. A parent-child trust relationship is formed when a domain is added under another domain in a tree. Two trees in the same forest cannot share a name (namespace). Let's say we have two trees in an AD forest: `inlanefreight.local` and `ilfreight.local`. A child domain of the first would be `corp.inlanefreight.local` while a child domain of the second could be `corp.ilfreight.local`. 

 > Note
 > *All domains in a tree share a standard Global Catalog which contains all information about objects that belong to the tree.*
 

### Container
A container objects hold other objects and have a define place in the directory subtree hierarchy.

### Leaf
A leaf objects do not contains other objects and are found to the end of the subtree directory.

### Global Unique Identifier (GUID)
A [GUID](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-objectguid) is a unique 128-bit value assigned when a domain user or group is created. This GUID value is unique across the enterprise, similar to a MAC address. 
*Every single object created by Active Directory is assigned a GUID*, not only user and group objects. The GUID is stored in the `ObjectGUID` attribute. When querying for an AD object (such as a user, group, computer, domain, domain controller, etc.), we can query for its `objectGUID` value using PowerShell or search for it by specifying its distinguished name, GUID, SID, or SAM account name. 
GUIDs are used by AD to identify objects internally. Searching in Active Directory by GUID value is probably the most accurate and reliable way to find the exact object you are looking for, especially if the global catalog may contain similar matches for an object name. Specifying the `ObjectGUID` value when performing AD enumeration will ensure that we get the most accurate results pertaining to the object we are searching for information about. 

The `ObjectGUID` property `never` changes and is associated with the object for as long as that object exists in the domain.


### Security Principals
[Security principals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/security-principals) *are anything that the operating system can authenticate*, including users, computer accounts, or even threads/processes that run in the context of a user or computer account (i.e., an application such as Tomcat running in the context of a service account within the domain). 
In AD, *security principles are domain objects that can manage access to other resources within the domain*. We can also have local user accounts and security groups used to control access to resources on only that specific computer. These are not managed by AD but rather by the [Security Accounts Manager (SAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Account_Manager).
### Security Identifier (SID)
A [security identifier](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/security-principals), or SID is used as a unique identifier for a security principal or security group. *Every account, group, or process has its own unique SID*, which, in an AD environment, is issued by the domain controller and stored in a secure database. A SID can only be used once. 
Even if the security principle is deleted, it can never be used again in that environment to identify another user or group. 
When a user logs in, the system creates an `access token` for them which contains the user's SID, the rights they have been granted, and the SIDs for any groups that the user is a member of. 
This token is used to check rights whenever the user performs an action on the computer.

There are also [well-known SIDs](https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=Well-known%20Security%20Identifiers) that are used to identify generic users and groups. These are the same across all operating systems. An example is the `Everyone` group.

### Distinguished Name (DN)
A [Distinguished Name (DN)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ldap/distinguished-names) describes the full path to an object in AD (such as `cn=bjones, ou=IT, ou=Employees, dc=inlanefreight, dc=local`). 
In this example, the user `bjones` works in the IT department of the company `Inlanefreight`, and his account is created in an `Organizational Unit (OU)` that holds accounts for company employees. 
The Common Name (CN) `bjones` is just one way the user object could be searched for or accessed within the domain.

### Relative Distinguished Name (RDN)
A [Relative Distinguished Name (RDN)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/object-names-and-identities) is a single component of the Distinguished Name that identifies the object as unique from other objects at the current level in the naming hierarchy. 
In our example, `bjones` is the Relative Distinguished Name of the object. AD does not allow two objects with the same name under the same parent container, but there can be two objects with the same RDNs that are still unique in the domain because they have different DNs. For example, the object `cn=bjones,dc=dev,dc=inlanefreight,dc=local` would be recognized as different from `cn=bjones,dc=inlanefreight,dc=local`.

![[Pasted image 20250308125342.png]]

### sAMAccountName
The [sAMAccountName](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/naming-properties#samaccountname) is the user's logon name. Here it would just be `bjones`. It must be a unique value and 20 or fewer characters.

### userPrincipalName
The [userPrincipalName](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/52250.active-directory-user-principal-name.aspx) attribute is another way to identify users in AD. This attribute consists of a prefix (the user account name) and a suffix (the domain name) in the format of `bjones@inlanefreight.local`. This attribute is not mandatory.

### FSMO Roles

In the early days of AD, if you had multiple DCs in an environment, they would fight over which DC gets to make changes, and sometimes changes would not be made properly. Microsoft then implemented "*last writer wins*," which could introduce its own problems if the last change breaks things. They then introduced a model in which a single "master" DC could apply changes to the domain while the others merely fulfilled authentication requests. 
This was a flawed design because if the master DC went down, no changes could be made to the environment until it was restored. 
To resolve this single point of failure model, Microsoft separated the various responsibilities that a DC can have into [Flexible Single Master Operation (FSMO)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/fsmo-roles) roles.
These give Domain Controllers (DC) the ability to continue authenticating users and granting permissions without interruption (authorization and authentication). 

There are five FSMO roles: `Schema Master` and `Domain Naming Master` (one of each per forest), `Relative ID (RID) Master` (one per domain), `Primary Domain Controller (PDC) Emulator` (one per domain), and `Infrastructure Master` (one per domain). 
All five roles are assigned to the first DC in the forest root domain in a new AD forest. 
Each time a new domain is added to a forest, only the RID Master, PDC Emulator, and Infrastructure Master roles are assigned to the new domain. 
FSMO roles are typically set when domain controllers are created, but *sysadmins can transfer these roles if needed*. These roles help replication in AD to run smoothly and ensure that critical services are operating correctly.

### Global Catalog
A [global catalog (GC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/global-catalog) is a domain controller that stores copies of ALL objects in an Active Directory forest. The GC stores a full copy of all objects in the current domain and a partial copy of objects that belong to other domains in the forest. Standard domain controllers hold a complete replica of objects belonging to its domain but not those of different domains in the forest. The GC allows both users and applications to find information about any objects in ANY domain in the forest. GC is a feature that is enabled on a domain controller and performs the following functions:

- Authentication (provided authorization for all groups that a user account belongs to, which is included when an access token is generated)
- Object search (making the directory structure within a forest transparent, allowing a search to be carried out across all domains in a forest by providing just one attribute about an object.)

### Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC)
A [Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/rodc-and-active-directory-schema) has a read-only Active Directory database. 
No AD account passwords are cached on an RODC (other than the RODC computer account & RODC KRBTGT passwords.) No changes are pushed out via an RODC's AD database, SYSVOL, or DNS. 
RODCs also include a read-only DNS server, allow for administrator role separation, reduce replication traffic in the environment, and prevent SYSVOL modifications from being replicated to other DCs.

### Replication
[Replication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/get-started/replication/active-directory-replication-concepts) happens in AD when AD objects are updated and transferred from one Domain Controller to another.
Whenever a DC is added, connection objects are created to manage replication between them. These connections are made by the **Knowledge Consistency Checker (KCC)** service, which is present on all DCs.
Replication ensures that changes are synchronized with all other DCs in a forest, helping to create a backup in case one domain controller fails.

### Service Principal Name (SPN)
A [Service Principal Name (SPN)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/service-principal-names) uniquely identifies a service instance. They are used by Kerberos authentication to associate an instance of a service with a logon account, allowing a client application to request the service to authenticate an account without needing to know the account name.

### Group Policy Object (GPO)
[Group Policy Objects (GPOs)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/policy/group-policy-objects) are virtual collections of policy settings. Each GPO has a unique GUID. A GPO can contain local file system settings or Active Directory settings. GPO settings can be applied to both user and computer objects. They can be applied to all users and computers within the domain or defined more granularly at the OU level.

### Access Control List (ACL)
An [Access Control List (ACL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-control-lists) is the ordered collection of Access Control Entries (ACEs) that apply to an object.

### Access Control Entries (ACEs)
Each [Access Control Entry (ACE)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-control-entries) in an ACL identifies a trustee (user account, group account, or logon session) and lists the access rights that are allowed, denied, or audited for the given trustee.

### Discretionary Access Control List (DACL)
DACLs define which security principles are granted or denied access to an object; *it contains a list of ACEs*. When a process tries to access a securable object, the system checks the ACEs in the object's DACL to determine whether or not to grant access.
If an object does NOT have a DACL, then the system will grant full access to everyone, but if the DACL has no ACE entries, the system will deny all access attempts.
ACEs in the DACL are checked in sequence until a match is found that allows the requested rights or until access is denied.

### System Access Control Lists (SACL)
Allows for administrators to log access attempts that are made to secured objects. ACEs specify the types of access attempts that cause the system to generate a record in the security event log.

### Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)
*An FQDN is the complete name for a specific computer or host.* It is written with the hostname and domain name in the format `[host name].[domain name].[tld]`. 
This is used to specify an object's location in the tree hierarchy of DNS. 
The FQDN can be used to locate hosts in an Active Directory without knowing the IP address, much like when browsing to a website such as google.com instead of typing in the associated IP address.
An example would be the host `DC01` in the domain `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`. The FQDN here would be `DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`.

### Tombstone
A [tombstone](https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=Tombstone) is a container object in AD that holds deleted AD objects. When an object is deleted from AD, the object remains for a set period of time known as the `Tombstone Lifetime,` and the `isDeleted` attribute is set to `TRUE`. 
Once an object exceeds the `Tombstone Lifetime`, it will be entirely removed. Microsoft recommends a tombstone lifetime of *180 days* to increase the usefulness of backups, but this value may differ across environments. 
Depending on the DC operating system version, this value will default to 60 or 180 days. 
If an object is deleted in a domain that does not have an AD Recycle Bin, it will become a tombstone object.
When this happens, the object is stripped of most of its attributes and placed in the `Deleted Objects` container for the duration of the `tombstoneLifetime`. 
It can be recovered, but any attributes that were lost can no longer be recovered.

### AD Recycle Bin
The [AD Recycle Bin](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ask-the-directory-services-team/the-ad-recycle-bin-understanding-implementing-best-practices-and/ba-p/396944) was first introduced in Windows Server 2008 R2 to facilitate the recovery of deleted AD objects. This made it easier for sysadmins to restore objects, avoiding the need to restore from backups, restarting Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), or rebooting a Domain Controller. When the AD Recycle Bin is enabled, any deleted objects are preserved for a period of time, facilitating restoration if needed. Sysadmins can set how long an object remains in a deleted, recoverable state. If this is not specified, the object will be restorable for a default value of 60 days. 
*The biggest advantage of using the AD Recycle Bin is that most of a deleted object's attributes are preserved, which makes it far easier to fully restore a deleted object to its previous state.*

### SYSVOL

The [SYSVOL](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/8548.active-directory-sysvol-and-netlogon.aspx) folder, or share, stores copies of public files in the domain such as system policies, Group Policy settings, logon/logoff scripts, and often contains other types of scripts that are executed to perform various tasks in the AD environment. The contents of the SYSVOL folder are replicated to all DCs within the environment using File Replication Services (FRS). You can read more about the SYSVOL structure [here](https://networkencyclopedia.com/sysvol-share/#Components-and-Structure).

### AdminSDHolder
The [AdminSDHolder](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/security-best-practices/appendix-c--protected-accounts-and-groups-in-active-directory) object is used to manage ACLs for members of built-in groups in AD marked as privileged. It acts as a container that holds the Security Descriptor applied to members of protected groups. The *SDProp (SD Propagator)* process runs on a schedule on the PDC Emulator Domain Controller. When this process runs, it checks members of protected groups to ensure that the correct ACL is applied to them. *It runs every hour by default*.

For example, suppose an attacker is able to create a malicious ACL entry to grant a user certain rights over a member of the Domain Admins group. 
*In that case, unless they modify other settings in AD, these rights will be removed (and they will lose any persistence they were hoping to achieve) when the SDProp process runs on the set interval.*


### dsHeuristics
The [dsHeuristics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-dsheuristics) attribute is a string value set on the Directory Service object used to define multiple forest-wide configuration settings. One of these settings is to exclude built-in groups from the [Protected Groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/security-best-practices/appendix-c--protected-accounts-and-groups-in-active-directory) list. Groups in this list are protected from modification via the `AdminSDHolder` object. 
If a group is excluded via the `dsHeuristics` attribute, then any changes that affect it will not be reverted when the SDProp process runs.


### adminCount
The [adminCount](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-admincount) attribute determines whether or not the SDProp process protects a user. 
If the value is set to `0` or not specified, the user is not protected. If the attribute value is set to `1`, the user is protected. 
Attackers will often look for accounts with the `adminCount` attribute set to `1` to target in an internal environment. These are often privileged accounts and may lead to further access or full domain compromise.


### Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)
ADUC is a GUI console commonly used for managing users, groups, computers, and contacts in AD. 
Changes made in ADUC can be done via PowerShell as well.

### ADSI Edit
ADSI Edit is a GUI tool used to manage objects in AD. 
*It provides access to far more than is available in ADUC and can be used to set or delete any attribute available on an object, add, remove, and move objects as well*.
It is a powerful tool that allows a user to access AD at a much deeper level. 
Great care should be taken when using this tool, as changes here could cause major problems in AD.

### sIDHistory

[This](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/cas-isp-unsecure-sid-history-attribute) attribute holds any SIDs that an object was assigned previously. 
It is usually used in migrations so a user can maintain the same level of access when migrated from one domain to another. 
This attribute can potentially be abused if set insecurely, allowing an attacker to gain prior elevated access that an account had before a migration if SID Filtering (or removing SIDs from another domain from a user's access token that could be used for elevated access) is not enabled.


### NTDS.DIT

The NTDS.DIT file can be considered the heart of Active Directory. 
*It is stored on a Domain Controller at `C:\Windows\NTDS\` and is a database that stores AD data such as information about user and group objects, group membership, and, most important to attackers and penetration testers, the password hashes for all users in the domain.*
Once full domain compromise is reached, an attacker can retrieve this file, extract the hashes, and either use them to perform a pass-the-hash attack or crack them offline using a tool such as Hashcat to access additional resources in the domain. 
If the setting [Store password with reversible encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/store-passwords-using-reversible-encryption) is enabled, then the NTDS.DIT will also store the cleartext passwords for all users created or who changed their password after this policy was set. 
While rare, some organizations may enable this setting if they use applications or protocols that need to use a user's existing password (and not Kerberos) for authentication.

### MSBROWSE

MSBROWSE is a Microsoft networking protocol that was used in early versions of Windows-based local area networks (LANs) to provide browsing services. It was used to maintain a list of resources, such as shared printers and files, that were available on the network, and to allow users to easily browse and access these resources.

In older version of Windows we could use `nbtstat -A ip-address` to search for the Master Browser. If we see MSBROWSE it means that's the Master Browser. Aditionally we could use `nltest` utility to query a Windows Master Browser for the names of the Domain Controllers.

Today, MSBROWSE is largely obsolete and is no longer in widespread use. Modern Windows-based LANs use the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol for file and printer sharing, and the Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol for browsing services.

## AD Objects
We will often see the term "objects" when referring to AD. What is an object? An object can be defined as ANY resource present within an Active Directory environment such as OUs, printers, users, domain controllers.

![[Pasted image 20250308162128.png]]
### Users

These are the users within the organization's AD environment. Users are considered `leaf objects`, which means that they cannot contain any other objects within them. Another example of a leaf object is a mailbox in Microsoft Exchange. A user object is considered a security principal and has a security identifier (SID) and a global unique identifier (GUID). User objects have many possible [attributes](http://www.kouti.com/tables/userattributes.htm), such as their display name, last login time, date of last password change, email address, account description, manager, address, and more. Depending on how a particular Active Directory environment is set up, there can be over 800 possible user attributes when accounting for ALL possible attributes as detailed [here](https://www.easy365manager.com/how-to-get-all-active-directory-user-object-attributes/). 
This example goes far beyond what is typically populated for a standard user in most environments but shows Active Directory's sheer size and complexity. 
They are a crucial target for attackers since gaining access to even a low privileged user can grant access to many objects and resources and allow for detailed enumeration of the entire domain (or forest).


### Contacts

A contact object is usually used to represent an external user and contains informational attributes such as first name, last name, email address, telephone number, etc. They are `leaf objects` and are NOT security principals (securable objects), so they don't have a SID, only a GUID. An example would be a contact card for a third-party vendor or a customer.

### Printers

A printer object points to a printer accessible within the AD network. 
Like a contact, a printer is a `leaf object` and not a security principal, so it only has a GUID. Printers have attributes such as the printer's name, driver information, port number, etc.

### Computers

A computer object is any computer joined to the AD network (workstation or server). 
Computers are `leaf objects` because they do not contain other objects. However, they are considered security principals and have a SID and a GUID. 
Like users, they are prime targets for attackers since full administrative access to a computer (as the all-powerful `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account) grants similar rights to a standard domain user and can be used to perform the majority of the enumeration tasks that a user account can (save for a few exceptions across domain trusts.)

### Shared Folders

A shared folder object points to a shared folder on the specific computer where the folder resides. Shared folders can have stringent access control applied to them and can be either accessible to everyone (even those without a valid AD account), open to only authenticated users (which means anyone with even the lowest privileged user account OR a computer account (`NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`) could access it), or be locked down to only allow certain users/groups access. Anyone not explicitly allowed access will be denied from listing or reading its contents. Shared folders are NOT security principals and only have a GUID. A shared folder's attributes can include the name, location on the system, security access rights.

### Groups

A group is considered a `container object` because it can contain other objects, including users, computers, and even other groups. A group IS regarded as a security principal and has a SID and a GUID. In AD, groups are a way to manage user permissions and access to other securable objects (both users and computers). Let's say we want to give 20 help desk users access to the Remote Management Users group on a jump host. Instead of adding the users one by one, we could add the group, and the users would inherit the intended permissions via their membership in the group. In Active Directory, we commonly see what are called "[nested groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/nesting-a-group-in-another-group)" (a group added as a member of another group), which can lead to a user(s) obtaining unintended rights. Nested group membership is something we see and often leverage during penetration tests. 

The tool [BloodHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound) helps to discover attack paths within a network and illustrate them in a graphical interface. It is excellent for auditing group membership and uncovering/seeing the sometimes unintended impacts of nested group membership. Groups in AD can have many [attributes](http://www.selfadsi.org/group-attributes.htm), the most common being the name, description, membership, and other groups that the group belongs to. Many other attributes can be set, which we will discuss more in-depth later in this module.

### Organizational Units (OUs)

An organizational unit, or OU from here on out, is a container that systems administrators can use to store similar objects for ease of administration. OUs are often used for administrative delegation of tasks without granting a user account full administrative rights. For example, we may have a top-level OU called Employees and then child OUs under it for the various departments such as Marketing, HR, Finance, Help Desk, etc. If an account were given the right to reset passwords over the top-level OU, this user would have the right to reset passwords for all users in the company. However, if the OU structure were such that specific departments were child OUs of the Help Desk OU, then any user placed in the Help Desk OU would have this right delegated to them if granted. Other tasks that may be delegated at the OU level include creating/deleting users, modifying group membership, managing Group Policy links, and performing password resets. 
OUs are very useful for managing Group Policy (which we will study later in this module) settings across a subset of users and groups within a domain. For example, we may want to set a specific password policy for privileged service accounts so these accounts could be placed in a particular OU and then have a Group Policy object assigned to it, which would enforce this password policy on all accounts placed inside of it. A few OU attributes include its name, members, security settings, and more.


### Domain
A domain is the structure of an AD network. Domains contain objects such as users and computers, which are organized into container objects: groups and OUs. Every domain has its own separate database and sets of policies that can be applied to any and all objects within the domain. Some policies are set by default (and can be tweaked), such as the domain password policy. In contrast, others are created and applied based on the organization's need, such as blocking access to cmd.exe for all non-administrative users or mapping shared drives at log in.

### Domain Controllers
Domain Controllers are essentially the brains of an AD network.
They handle authentication requests, verify users on the network, and control who can access the various resources in the domain.
All access requests are validated via the domain controller and privileged access requests are based on predetermined roles assigned to users. It also enforces security policies and stores information about every other object in the domain.

### Sites
A site in AD is a set of computers across one or more subnets connected using high-speed links. They are used to make replication across domain controllers run efficiently.

### Built-in
In AD, built-in is a container that holds [default groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups) in an AD domain. They are predefined when an AD domain is created.

### Foreign Security Principals

A foreign security principal (FSP) is an object created in AD to represent a security principal that belongs to a trusted external forest. 
They are created when an object such as a user, group, or computer from an external (outside of the current) forest is added to a group in the current domain.
They are created automatically after adding a security principal to a group.
Every foreign security principal is a placeholder object that holds the SID of the foreign object (an object that belongs to another forest.) Windows uses this SID to resolve the object's name via the trust relationship. 
FSPs are created in a specific container named `ForeignSecurityPrincipals` with a distinguished name like `cn=ForeignSecurityPrincipals,dc=inlanefreight,dc=local`.


## AD Functionality
As mentioned before, there are five Flexible Single Master Operation (FSMO) roles. These roles can be defined as follows:

| **Roles**                  | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Schema Master`            | This role manages the read/write copy of the AD schema, which defines all attributes that can apply to an object in AD.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `Domain Naming Master`     | Manages domain names and ensures that two domains of the same name are not created in the same forest.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `Relative ID (RID) Master` | The RID Master assigns blocks of RIDs to other DCs within the domain that can be used for new objects. The RID Master helps ensure that multiple objects are not assigned the same SID. Domain object SIDs are the domain SID combined with the RID number assigned to the object to make the unique SID.          |
| `PDC Emulator`             | The host with this role would be the authoritative DC in the domain and respond to authentication requests, password changes, and manage Group Policy Objects (GPOs). The PDC Emulator also maintains time within the domain.                                                                                      |
| `Infrastructure Master`    | This role translates GUIDs, SIDs, and DNs between domains. This role is used in organizations with multiple domains in a single forest. The Infrastructure Master helps them to communicate. If this role is not functioning properly, Access Control Lists (ACLs) will show SIDs instead of fully resolved names. |

Depending on the organization, these roles may be assigned to specific DCs or as defaults each time a new DC is added. Issues with FSMO roles will lead to authentication and authorization difficulties within a domain.
### Domain and Forest Functional Levels

Microsoft introduced functional levels to determine the various features and capabilities available in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) at the domain and forest level. They are also used to specify which Windows Server operating systems can run a Domain Controller in a domain or forest. [This](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc754918\(v=ws.10\)?redirectedfrom=MSDN) and [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/active-directory-functional-levels) article describe both the domain and forest functional levels from Windows 2000 native to Windows Server 2012 R2. Below is a quick overview of the differences in `domain functional levels` from Windows 2000 native up to Windows Server 2016, aside from all default Active Directory Directory Services features from the level just below it (or just the default AD DS features in the case of Windows 2000 native.)

|Domain Functional Level|Features Available|Supported Domain Controller Operating Systems|
|---|---|---|
|Windows 2000 native|Universal groups for distribution and security groups, group nesting, group conversion (between security and distribution and security groups), SID history.|Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2003, Windows 2000|
|Windows Server 2003|Netdom.exe domain management tool, lastLogonTimestamp attribute introduced, well-known users and computers containers, constrained delegation, selective authentication.|Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2003|
|Windows Server 2008|Distributed File System (DFS) replication support, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES 128 and AES 256) support for the Kerberos protocol, Fine-grained password policies|Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2008|
|Windows Server 2008 R2|Authentication mechanism assurance, Managed Service Accounts|Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008 R2|
|Windows Server 2012|KDC support for claims, compound authentication, and Kerberos armoring|Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012|
|Windows Server 2012 R2|Extra protections for members of the Protected Users group, Authentication Policies, Authentication Policy Silos|Windows Server 2012 R2|
|Windows Server 2016|[Smart card required for interactive logon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/interactive-logon-require-smart-card) new [Kerberos](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/kerberos/whats-new-in-kerberos-authentication) features and new [credential protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/credentials-protection-and-management/whats-new-in-credential-protection) features|Windows Server 2019 and Windows Server 2016|

A new functional level was not added with the release of Windows Server 2019. However, Windows Server 2008 functional level is the minimum requirement for adding Server 2019 Domain Controllers to an environment. Also, the target domain has to use [DFS-R](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/dfs-replication/dfsr-overview) for SYSVOL replication.

Forest functional levels have introduced a few key capabilities over the years:

|**Version**|**Capabilities**|
|---|---|
|`Windows Server 2003`|saw the introduction of the forest trust, domain renaming, read-only domain controllers (RODC), and more.|
|`Windows Server 2008`|All new domains added to the forest default to the Server 2008 domain functional level. No additional new features.|
|`Windows Server 2008 R2`|Active Directory Recycle Bin provides the ability to restore deleted objects when AD DS is running.|
|`Windows Server 2012`|All new domains added to the forest default to the Server 2012 domain functional level. No additional new features.|
|`Windows Server 2012 R2`|All new domains added to the forest default to the Server 2012 R2 domain functional level. No additional new features.|
|`Windows Server 2016`|[Privileged access management (PAM) using Microsoft Identity Manager (MIM).](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/whats-new-active-directory-domain-services#privileged-access-management)|

### Trusts

A trust is used to establish `forest-forest` or `domain-domain` authentication, allowing users to access resources in (or administer) another domain outside of the domain their account resides in. A trust creates a link between the authentication systems of two domains.

There are several trust types.

|**Trust Type**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Parent-child`|Domains within the same forest. The child domain has a two-way transitive trust with the parent domain.|
|`Cross-link`|a trust between child domains to speed up authentication.|
|`External`|A non-transitive trust between two separate domains in separate forests which are not already joined by a forest trust. This type of trust utilizes SID filtering.|
|`Tree-root`|a two-way transitive trust between a forest root domain and a new tree root domain. They are created by design when you set up a new tree root domain within a forest.|
|`Forest`|a transitive trust between two forest root domains.|

Trusts can be transitive or non-transitive.

- A transitive trust means that trust is extended to objects that the child domain trusts.
    
- In a non-transitive trust, only the child domain itself is trusted.
    

Trusts can be set up to be one-way or two-way (bidirectional).

- In bidirectional trusts, users from both trusting domains can access resources.
- In a one-way trust, only users in a trusted domain can access resources in a trusting domain, not vice-versa. The direction of trust is opposite to the direction of access.

Often, domain trusts are set up improperly and provide unintended attack paths. Also, trusts set up for ease of use may not be reviewed later for potential security implications. Mergers and acquisitions can result in bidirectional trusts with acquired companies, unknowingly introducing risk into the acquiring company’s environment. It is not uncommon to be able to perform an attack such as *Kerberoasting* against a domain outside the principal domain and obtain a user that has administrative access within the principal domain.
