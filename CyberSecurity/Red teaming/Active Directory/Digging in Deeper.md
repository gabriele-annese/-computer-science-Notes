# Security in Active Directory

---

As we have progressed through this module, we have looked at the many features and functionalities built into Active Directory. All of which are built around the premise of central management and the ability to share information quickly, at will, to a large userbase. Active Directory can be considered insecure by design because of this. A default Active Directory installation will be missing many hardening measures, settings, and tools that can be used to secure an AD implementation. When we think about cybersecurity, one of the first things that come up is the balance between Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, also known as the [CIA Triad](https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/education/what-is-the-cia-triad). Finding this balance is hard, and AD leans heavily toward `Availability` and `Confidentiality` at its core.

#### CIA Triad

![Diagram of CIA Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability. Confidentiality focuses on access control, Integrity ensures data authenticity, and Availability ensures resource accessibility.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/74/CIA-triad-diag.png)

We can help balance the scales by utilizing Microsoft's built-in features that can be enabled/tweaked to harden AD against common attacks. The list below is not exhaustive. Many other general security hardening principles must be in place within an organization to ensure a proper `defense-in-depth` approach (having an accurate asset inventory, vulnerability patches, configuration management, endpoint protection, security awareness training, network segmentation, etc.). This section can be considered the bare minimum general AD security best practices that any organization will benefit from. We will deep dive into Active Directory Defense in a later module. Let's dive in and start with a few general hardening measures for AD.

---

## General Active Directory Hardening Measures

The [Microsoft Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46899) is used to randomize and rotate local administrator passwords on Windows hosts and prevent lateral movement.

#### LAPS

Accounts can be set up to have their password rotated on a fixed interval (i.e., 12 hours, 24 hours, etc.). This free tool can be beneficial in reducing the impact of an individual compromised host in an AD environment. Organizations should not rely on tools like this alone. Still, when combined with other hardening measures and security best practices, it can be a very effective tool for local administrator account password management.

#### Audit Policy Settings (Logging and Monitoring)

Every organization needs to have logging and monitoring setup to detect and react to unexpected changes or activities that may indicate an attack. Effective logging and monitoring can be used to detect an attacker or unauthorized employee adding a user or computer, modifying an object in AD, changing an account password, accessing a system in an unauthorized or non-standard manner, performing an attack such as password spraying, or more advanced attacks such as modern Kerberos attacks.

#### Group Policy Security Settings

As mentioned earlier in the module, Group Policy Objects (GPOs) are virtual collections of policy settings that can be applied to specific users, groups, and computers at the OU level. These can be used to apply a wide variety of [security policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/security-policy-settings) to help harden Active Directory. The following is a non-exhaustive list of the types of security policies that can be applied:

- [Account Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/account-policies) - Manage how user accounts interact with the domain. These include the password policy, account lockout policy, and Kerberos-related settings such as the lifetime of Kerberos tickets
    
- [Local Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/security-options) - These apply to a specific computer and include the security event audit policy, user rights assignments (user privileges on a host), and specific security settings such as the ability to install drivers, whether the administrator and guest accounts are enabled, renaming the guest and administrator accounts, preventing users from installing printers or using removable media, and a variety of network access and network security controls.
    
- [Software Restriction Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/software-restriction-policies/software-restriction-policies) - Settings to control what software can be run on a host.
    
- [Application Control Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/windows-defender-application-control) - Settings to control which applications can be run by certain users/groups. This may include blocking certain users from running all executables, Windows Installer files, scripts, etc. Administrators use [AppLocker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/applocker/applocker-overview) to restrict access to certain types of applications and files. It is not uncommon to see organizations block access to CMD and PowerShell (among other executables) for users that do not require them for their day-to-day job. These policies are imperfect and can often be bypassed but necessary for a defense-in-depth strategy.
    
- [Advanced Audit Policy Configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/secpol-advanced-security-audit-policy-settings) - A variety of settings that can be adjusted to audit activities such as file access or modification, account logon/logoff, policy changes, privilege usage, and more.
    

#### Advanced Audit Policy

![Group Policy Management Editor showing Default Domain Policy under Computer Configuration. Advanced Audit Policy Configuration settings are not configured.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/74/adv-audit-pol.png)

#### Update Management (SCCM/WSUS)

Proper patch management is critical for any organization, especially those running Windows/Active Directory systems. The [Windows Server Update Service (WSUS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-server-update-services/get-started/windows-server-update-services-wsus) can be installed as a role on a Windows Server and can be used to minimize the manual task of patching Windows systems. `System Center Configuration Manager` (SCCM) is a paid solution that relies on the WSUS Windows Server role being installed and offers more features than WSUS on its own. A patch management solution can help ensure timely deployment of patches and maximize coverage, making sure that no hosts miss critical security patches. If an organization relies on a manual method for applying patches, it could take a very long time depending on the size of the environment and also could result in systems being missed and left vulnerable.

#### Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA)

A gMSA is an account managed by the domain that offers a higher level of security than other types of service accounts for use with non-interactive applications, services, processes, and tasks that are run automatically but require credentials to run. *They provide automatic password management with a 120 character password generated by the domain controller*. The password is changed at a regular interval and does not need to be known by any user. It allows for credentials to be used across multiple hosts.

#### Security Groups

Security groups offer an easy way to assign access to network resources. They can be used to assign specific rights to the group (instead of directly to the user) to determine what members of the group can do within the AD environment. Active Directory automatically creates some [default security groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups#active-directory-default-security-groups-by-operating-system-version) during installation. Some examples are Account Operators, Administrators, Backup Operators, Domain Admins, and Domain Users. These groups can also be used to assign permission to access resources (i.e., a file share, folder, printer, or a document). Security groups help ensure you can assign granular permissions to users en masse instead of individually managing each user.

#### Built-in AD Security Groups

![Active Directory Users and Computers interface showing security groups under INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL. Groups include Access Control Assistance Operators, Account Operators, Administrators, and Backup Operators, with descriptions of their permissions.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/74/def-sec-groups.png)

#### Account Separation

Administrators must have two separate accounts. One for their day-to-day work and a second for any administrative tasks they must perform. For example, a user could log into their machine using their `sjones` account to send/receive an email, create documents, etc. They should have a separate account, such as `sjones_adm`, to access a [secure administrative host](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/security-best-practices/implementing-secure-administrative-hosts) used to perform administrative tasks. This can help ensure that if a user's host is compromised (through a phishing attack, for example), the attacker would be limited to that host and would not obtain credentials for a highly privileged user with considerable access within the domain. It is also essential for the individual to use different passwords for each account to mitigate the risk of password reuse attacks if their non-admin account is compromised.

#### Password Complexity Policies + Passphrases + 2FA

Ideally, an organization should be using passphrases or large randomly generated passwords using an enterprise password manager. The standard 7-8 character passwords can be cracked offline using a tool such as Hashcat very quickly with a GPU password cracking rig. Shorter, less complex passwords may also be guessed through a password spraying attack, giving an attacker a foothold in the domain. Password complexity rules alone in AD are not enough to ensure strong passwords. For example, the password `Welcome1` would meet the standard complexity rules (3 out of 4 of uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character) but would be one of the first passwords I would try in a password spraying attack. An organization should also consider implementing a password filter to disallow passwords containing the months or seasons of the year, the company name, and common words such as `password` and `welcome`. The minimum password length for standard users should be at least 12 characters and ideally longer for administrators/service accounts. Another important security measure is the implementation of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Remote Desktop Access to any host. This can help to limit lateral movement attempts that may rely on GUI access to a host.


#### Limiting Domain Admin Account Usage

All-powerful Domain Admin accounts should only be used to log in to Domain Controllers, not personal workstations, jump hosts, web servers, etc. This can significantly reduce the impact of an attack and cut down potential attack paths should a host be compromised. This would ensure that Domain Admin account passwords are not left in memory on hosts throughout the environment.

#### Periodically Auditing and Removing Stale Users and Objects

It is important for an organization to periodically audit Active Directory and remove or disable any unused accounts. For example, there may be a privileged service account that was created eight years ago with a very weak password that was never changed, and the account is no longer in use. Even if the password policy had since been changed to be more resistant to attacks such as password spraying, an account such as this may be a quick and easy foothold or method for lateral movement or privilege escalation within the domain.

#### Auditing Permissions and Access

Organizations should also periodically perform access control audits to ensure that users only have the level of access required for their day-to-day work. It is important to audit local admin rights, the number of Domain Admins (do we really need 30 of them?), and Enterprise Admins to limit the attack surface, file share access, user rights (i.e., membership in certain privileged security groups), and more.

#### Audit Policies & Logging

Visibility into the domain is a must. An organization can achieve this through robust logging and then using rules to detect anomalous activity (such as many failed login attempts that could be indicative of a password spraying attack) or indicators that a Kerberoasting attack is being attempted. These can also be used to detect Active Directory enumeration. It is worth familiarizing ourselves with Microsoft's [Audit Policy Recommendations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/security-best-practices/audit-policy-recommendations) to help detect compromise.

#### Using Restricted Groups

[Restricted Groups](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/20402.active-directory-group-policy-restricted-groups.aspx) allow for administrators to configure group membership via Group Policy. They can be used for a number of reasons, such as controlling membership in the local administrator's group on all hosts in the domain by restricting it to just the local Administrator account and Domain Admins and controlling membership in the highly privileged Enterprise Admins and Schema Admins groups and other key administrative groups.

#### Limiting Server Roles

It is important not to install additional roles on sensitive hosts, such as installing the `Internet Information Server` (IIS) role on a Domain Controller. This would increase the attack surface of the Domain Controller, and this type of role should be installed on a separate standalone web server. Some other examples would be not hosting web applications on an Exchange mail server and separating web servers and database servers out to different hosts. This type of role separation can help to reduce the impact of a successful attack.

#### Limiting Local Admin and RDP Rights

Organizations should tightly control which users have local admin rights on which computers. As stated above, this can be achieved using Restricted Groups. I have seen too many organizations with the entire Domain Users group with local admin rights on one or more hosts. This would allow an attacker that compromises `ANY` account (even a very low privileged one) to access that host as a local admin and potentially obtain sensitive data or steal high privileged domain account credentials from memory if another user is logged in. The same goes for Remote Desktop (RDP) rights. If many users can RDP to one or many machines, this increases the risk of sensitive data exposure or potential privilege escalation attacks, leading to further compromise.

# Examining Group Policy

---

Group Policy is a Windows feature that provides administrators with a wide array of advanced settings that can apply to both user and computer accounts in a Windows environment. Every Windows host has a Local Group Policy editor to manage local settings. For our purposes, we will focus on Group Policy in a domain context for managing users and computers in Active Directory. Group Policy is a powerful tool for managing and configuring user settings, operating systems, and applications. Group Policy is also a potent tool for managing security in a domain environment. From a security context, leveraging Group Policy is one of the best ways to widely affect your enterprise's security posture. Active Directory is by no means secure "out of the box," and Group Policy, when used properly, is a crucial part of a defense-in-depth strategy.

While Group Policy is an excellent tool for managing the security of a domain, it can also be abused by attackers. Gaining rights over a Group Policy Object could lead to lateral movement, privilege escalation, and even full domain compromise if the attacker can leverage them in a way to take over a high-value user or computer. They can also be used as a way for an attacker to maintain persistence within a network. Understanding how Group Policy works will give us a leg up against attackers and can help us greatly on penetration tests, sometimes finding nuanced misconfigurations that other penetration testers may miss.

---

## Group Policy Objects (GPOs)

A [Group Policy Object (GPO)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/policy/group-policy-objects) is a virtual collection of policy settings that can be applied to `user(s)` or `computer(s)`. GPOs include policies such as screen lock timeout, disabling USB ports, enforcing a custom domain password policy, installing software, managing applications, customizing remote access settings, and much more. Every GPO has a unique name and is assigned a unique identifier (a GUID). They can be linked to a specific OU, domain, or site. A single GPO can be linked to multiple containers, and any container can have multiple GPOs applied to it. They can be applied to individual users, hosts, or groups by being applied directly to an OU. Every GPO contains one or more Group Policy settings that may apply at the local machine level or within the Active Directory context.

---

## Example GPOs

Some examples of things we can do with GPOs may include:

- Establishing different password policies for service accounts, admin accounts, and standard user accounts using separate GPOs
- Preventing the use of removable media devices (such as USB devices)
- Enforcing a screensaver with a password
- Restricting access to applications that a standard user may not need, such as cmd.exe and PowerShell
- Enforcing audit and logging policies
- Blocking users from running certain types of programs and scripts
- Deploying software across a domain
- Blocking users from installing unapproved software
- Displaying a logon banner whenever a user logs into a system
- Disallowing LM hash usage in the domain
- Running scripts when computers start/shutdown or when a user logs in/out of their machine

Let's use as example a default Windows Server 2008 Active Directory implementation, password complexity is enforced by default. The password complexity requirements are as follows:

- Passwords must be at least 7 characters long.
- Passwords must contain characters from at least three of the following four categories:
    - Uppercase characters (A-Z)
    - Lowercase characters (a-z)
    - Numbers (0-9)
    - Special characters (e.g. !@#$%^&*()_+|~-=`{}[]:";'<>?,./)

These are just a few examples of what can be done with Group Policy. There are hundreds of settings that can be applied within a GPO, which can get extremely granular. For example, below are some options that we can set for Remote Desktop sessions.

#### RDP GPO Settings

![Group Policy Management Editor showing Remote Session Environment settings under Remote Desktop Services. Settings include RemoteFX for Windows Server 2008 R2 and various display and graphics configurations.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/74/rdp_settings.png)

GPO settings are processed using the hierarchical structure of AD and are applied using the `Order of Precedence` rule as seen in the table below:

#### Order of Precedence

| **Level**                                  | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Local Group Policy`                       | The policies are defined directly to the host locally outside the domain. Any setting here will be overwritten if a similar setting is defined at a higher level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `Site Policy`                              | Any policies specific to the Enterprise Site that the host resides in. Remember that enterprise environments can span large campuses and even across countries. So it stands to reason that a site might have its own policies to follow that could differentiate it from the rest of the organization. Access Control policies are a great example of this. Say a specific building or `site` performs secret or restricted research and requires a higher level of authorization for access to resources. You could specify those settings at the site level and ensure they are linked so as not to be overwritten by domain policy. This is also a great way to perform actions like printer and share mapping for users in specific sites. |
| `Domain-wide Policy`                       | Any settings you wish to have applied across the domain as a whole. For example, setting the password policy complexity level, configuring a Desktop background for all users, and setting a Notice of Use and Consent to Monitor banner at the login screen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `Organizational Unit` (OU)                 | These settings would affect users and computers who belong to specific OUs. You would want to place any unique settings here that are role-specific. For example, the mapping of a particular share drive that can only be accessed by HR, access to specific resources like printers, or the ability for IT admins to utilize PowerShell and command-prompt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `Any OU Policies nested within other OU's` | Settings at this level would reflect special permissions for objects within nested OUs. For example, providing Security Analysts a specific set of Applocker policy settings that differ from the standard IT Applocker settings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

We can manage Group Policy from the Group Policy Management Console (found under Administrative Tools in the Start Menu on a domain controller), custom applications, or using the PowerShell [GroupPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/grouppolicy/?view=windowsserver2022-ps) module via command line. 

*The Default Domain Policy* is the default GPO that is automatically created and linked to the domain. It has the highest precedence of all GPOs and is applied by default to all users and computers. Generally, it is best practice to use this default GPO to manage default settings that will apply domain-wide. The Default Domain Controllers policy is also created automatically with a domain and sets baseline security and auditing settings for all domain controllers in a given domain. It can be customized as needed, like any GPO.

## GPO Order of Precedence

GPOs are processed from the top down when viewing them from a domain organizational standpoint. A GPO linked to an OU at the highest level in an Active Directory network (at the domain level, for example) would be processed first, followed by those linked to a child OU, etc. This means that a GPO linked directly to an OU containing user or computer objects is processed last. In other words, a GPO attached to a specific OU would have precedence over a GPO attached at the domain level because it will be processed last and could run the risk of overriding settings in a GPO higher up in the domain hierarchy. One more thing to keep track of with precedence is that a setting configured in Computer policy will always have a higher priority of the same setting applied to a user. The following graphic illustrates precedence and how it is applied.

#### GPO Precedence Order

![Diagram of Group Policy processing order: Local Security Policy, Site Policy, Domain Policy, Parent OU Policy, Child OU Policy. Descriptions of Computer, User, and Group Policy settings application.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/74/gpo_levels.png)

Let's look at another example using the Group Policy Management Console on a Domain Controller. In this image, we see several GPOs. The `Disabled Forced Restarts` GPO will have precedence over the `Logon Banner` GPO since it would be processed last. Any settings configured in the `Disabled Forced Restarts` GPO could potentially override settings in any GPOs higher up in the hierarchy (including those linked to the `Corp` OU).

#### GPMC Hive Example

![Group Policy Management interface showing Corp OU under INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL. Linked Group Policy Objects: Disallow LM Hash, Block Removable Media, Disable Guest Account, all enabled.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/74/gpo_precedence.png)

This image also shows an example of several GPOs being linked to the `Corp` OU. When more than one GPO is linked to an OU, they are processed based on the `Link Order`. The GPO with the lowest Link Order is processed last, or the GPO with link order 1 has the highest precedence, then 2, and 3, and so on. So in our example above, the `Disallow LM Hash` GPO will have precedence over the `Block Removable Media` and `Disable Guest Account` GPOs, meaning it will be processed first.

It is possible to specify the `Enforced` option to enforce settings in a specific GPO. If this option is set, policy settings in GPOs linked to lower OUs `CANNOT` override the settings. If a GPO is set at the domain level with the `Enforced` option selected, the settings contained in that GPO will be applied to all OUs in the domain and cannot be overridden by lower-level OU policies. In the past, this setting was called `No Override` and was set on the container in question under Active Directory Users and Computers. Below we can see an example of an `Enforced` GPO, where the `Logon Banner` GPO is taking precedence over GPOs linked to lower OUs and therefore will not be overridden.

#### Enforced GPO Policy Precedence

Linked Group Policy Objects: Logon Banner, Disallow LM Hash, Block Removable Media, Disable Guest Account, Default Domain Policy, all enabled.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/74/gpo_enforced.png)

Regardless of which GPO is set to enforced, if the `Default Domain Policy` GPO is enforced, it will take precedence over all GPOs at all levels.

#### Default Domain Policy Override

Linked Group Policy Objects: Default Domain Policy, Disable Forced Restarts, Disallow LM Hash, Block Removable Media, Disable Guest Account, all enabled.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/74/default_gpo.png)

It is also possible to set the `Block inheritance` option on an OU. If this is specified for a particular OU, then policies higher up (such as at the domain level) will NOT be applied to this OU. If both options are set, the `No Override` option has precedence over the `Block inheritance` option. Here is a quick example. The `Computers` OU is inheriting GPOs set on the `Corp` OU in the below image.

Linked Group Policy Objects: Logon Banner, Disable Forced Restarts, Disallow LM Hash, Block Removable Media, Disable Guest Account, Default Domain Policy, all enabled.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/74/inheritance.png)

If the `Block Inheritance` option is chosen, we can see that the 3 GPOs applied higher up to the `Corp` OU are no longer enforced on the `Computers` OU.

## Group Policy Refresh Frequency

When a new GPO is created, the settings are not automatically applied right away. Windows performs periodic Group Policy updates, which by default is done every 90 minutes with a randomized offset of +/- 30 minutes for users and computers. The period is only 5 minutes for domain controllers to update by default. When a new GPO is created and linked, it could take up to 2 hours (120 minutes) until the settings take effect. This random offset of +/- 30 minutes is set to avoid overwhelming domain controllers by having all clients request Group Policy from the domain controller simultaneously.

It is possible to change the default refresh interval within Group Policy itself. Furthermore, we can issue the command `gpupdate /force` to kick off the update process. This command will compare the GPOs currently applied on the machine against the domain controller and either modify or skip them depending on if they have changed since the last automatic update.

We can modify the refresh interval via Group Policy by clicking on `Computer Configuration --> Policies --> Administrative Templates --> System --> Group Policy` and selecting `Set Group Policy refresh interval for computers`. While it can be changed, it should not be set to occur too often, or it could cause network congestion leading to replication issues.

## Security Considerations of GPOs

As mentioned earlier, GPOs can be used to carry out attacks. These attacks may include adding additional rights to a user account that we control, adding a local administrator to a host, or creating an immediate scheduled task to run a malicious command such as modifying group membership, adding a new admin account, establishing a reverse shell connection, or even installing targeted malware throughout a domain. These attacks typically happen when a user has the rights required to modify a GPO that applies to an OU that contains either a user account that we control or a computer.

Below is an example of a GPO attack path identified using the [BloodHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound) tool. This example shows that the `Domain Users` group can modify the `Disconnect Idle RDP` GPO due to nested group membership. In this case, we would next look to see which OUs this GPO applies to and if we can leverage these rights to gain control over a high-value user (administrator or Domain Admin) or computer (server, DC, or critical host) and move laterally to escalate privileges within the domain.
