## Kerberos

Kerberos has been the default authentication protocol for domain accounts since Windows 2000. Kerberos is an open standard and allows for interoperability with other systems using the same standard. When a user logs into their PC, Kerberos is used to authenticate them via mutual authentication, or both the user and the server verify their identity. Kerberos is a stateless authentication protocol based on tickets instead of transmitting user passwords over the network. As part of Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), Domain Controllers have a Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) that issues tickets. When a user initiates a login request to a system, the client they are using to authenticate requests a ticket from the KDC, encrypting the request with the user's password. If the KDC can decrypt the request (AS-REQ) using their password, it will create a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) and transmit it to the user. The user then presents its TGT to a Domain Controller to request a Ticket Granting Service (TGS) ticket, encrypted with the associated service's NTLM password hash. Finally, the client requests access to the required service by presenting the TGS to the application or service, which decrypts it with its password hash. If the entire process completes appropriately, the user will be permitted to access the requested service or application.

Kerberos authentication effectively decouples users' credentials from their requests to consumable resources, ensuring that their password isn't transmitted over the network (i.e., accessing an internal SharePoint intranet site). The Kerberos Key Distribution Centre (KDC) does not record previous transactions. Instead, the Kerberos Ticket Granting Service ticket (TGS) relies on a valid Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT). It assumes that if the user has a valid TGT, they must have proven their identity. The following diagram walks through this process at a high level.

#### Kerberos Authentication Process

1. When a user logs in, their password is used to encrypt a timestamp, which is sent to the *Key Distribution Center (KDC)* to verify the integrity of the authentication by decrypting it. The KDC then issues a *Ticket-Granting Ticket (TGT)*, encrypting it with the secret key of the krbtgt account. This TGT is used to request service tickets for accessing network resources, allowing authentication without repeatedly transmitting the user's credentials. This process decouples the user's credentials from requests to resources.
2. The KDC service on the DC checks the authentication service request (AS-REQ), verifies the user information, and creates a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT), which is delivered to the user.|
3. The user presents the TGT to the DC, requesting a Ticket Granting Service (TGS) ticket for a specific service. This is the TGS-REQ. If the TGT is successfully validated, its data is copied to create a TGS ticket.
4. The TGS is encrypted with the NTLM password hash of the service or computer account in whose context the service instance is running and is delivered to the user in the TGS_REP.
5. The user presents the TGS to the service, and if it is valid, the user is permitted to connect to the resource (AP_REQ).

The *Kerberos protocol uses port 88* (both TCP and UDP). When enumerating an Active Directory environment, we can often locate Domain Controllers by performing port scans looking for open port 88 using a tool such as Nmap.

## DNS

Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) uses DNS to allow clients (workstations, servers, and other systems that communicate with the domain) to locate Domain Controllers and for Domain Controllers that host the directory service to communicate amongst themselves. DNS is used to resolve hostnames to IP addresses and is broadly used across internal networks and the internet. 

Private internal networks use Active Directory DNS namespaces to facilitate communications between servers, clients, and peers. AD maintains a database of services running on the network in the form of service records (SRV). 
These service records allow clients in an AD environment to locate services that they need, such as a file server, printer, or Domain Controller. 
Dynamic DNS is used to make changes in the DNS database automatically should a system's IP address change. Making these entries manually would be very time-consuming and leave room for error. 
If the DNS database does not have the correct IP address for a host, clients will not be able to locate and communicate with it on the network. 
When a client joins the network, it locates the Domain Controller by sending a query to the DNS service, retrieving an SRV record from the DNS database, and transmitting the Domain Controller's hostname to the client. The client then uses this hostname to obtain the IP address of the Domain Controller. DNS uses TCP and UDP port 53. UDP port 53 is the default, but it falls back to TCP when no longer able to communicate and DNS messages are larger than 512 bytes.

#### Forward DNS Lookup

Let's look at an example. We can perform a `nslookup` for the domain name and retrieve all Domain Controllers' IP addresses in a domain.

Kerberos, DNS, LDAP, MSRPC

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> nslookup INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL

Server:  172.16.6.5
Address:  172.16.6.5

Name:    INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
Address:  172.16.6.5
```

#### Reverse DNS Lookup

If we would like to obtain the DNS name of a single host using the IP address, we can do this as follows:

Kerberos, DNS, LDAP, MSRPC

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> nslookup 172.16.6.5

Server:  172.16.6.5
Address:  172.16.6.5

Name:    ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
Address:  172.16.6.5
```

#### Finding IP Address of a Host

If we would like to find the IP address of a single host, we can do this in reverse. We can do this with or without specifying the FQDN.

Kerberos, DNS, LDAP, MSRPC

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> nslookup ACADEMY-EA-DC01

Server:   172.16.6.5
Address:  172.16.6.5

Name:    ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
Address:  172.16.6.5
```

## LDAP

Active Directory supports [Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol) for directory lookups. LDAP is an open-source and cross-platform protocol used for authentication against various directory services (such as AD). 
*The latest LDAP specification is [Version 3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4511), published as RFC 4511.* 
A firm understanding of how LDAP works in an AD environment is crucial for attackers and defenders. 
**LDAP uses port 389, and LDAP over SSL (LDAPS) communicates over port 636.**

AD stores user account information and security information such as passwords and facilitates sharing this information with other devices on the network. LDAP is the language that applications use to communicate with other servers that provide directory services. In other words, LDAP is how systems in the network environment can "speak" to AD.

An LDAP session begins by first connecting to an LDAP server, also known as a Directory System Agent. The Domain Controller in AD actively listens for LDAP requests, such as security authentication requests.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/74/LDAP_auth.png)

The relationship between AD and LDAP can be compared to Apache and HTTP. The same way Apache is a web server that uses the HTTP protocol, Active Directory is a directory server that uses the LDAP protocol.

While uncommon, you may come across organization while performing an assessment that do not have AD but are using LDAP, meaning that they most likely use another type of LDAP server such as [OpenLDAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenLDAP).

#### AD LDAP Authentication

LDAP is set up to authenticate credentials against AD using a "BIND" operation to set the authentication state for an LDAP session. There are two types of LDAP authentication.

1. `Simple Authentication`: This includes anonymous authentication, unauthenticated authentication, and username/password authentication. Simple authentication means that a `username` and `password` create a BIND request to authenticate to the LDAP server.
    
2. `SASL Authentication`: [The Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Authentication_and_Security_Layer) framework uses other authentication services, such as Kerberos, to bind to the LDAP server and then uses this authentication service (Kerberos in this example) to authenticate to LDAP. The LDAP server uses the LDAP protocol to send an LDAP message to the authorization service, which initiates a series of challenge/response messages resulting in either successful or unsuccessful authentication. SASL can provide additional security due to the separation of authentication methods from application protocols.
    

> NOTE
> 
> LDAP authentication messages are sent in **cleartext** by default so anyone can sniff out LDAP messages on the internal network. 
> It is recommended to use *TLS encryption* or similar to safeguard this information in transit.


## MSRPC

As mentioned above, MSRPC is Microsoft's implementation of Remote Procedure Call (RPC), an interprocess communication technique used for client-server model-based applications. Windows systems use MSRPC to access systems in Active Directory using four key RPC interfaces.

Organizations can [protect](https://stealthbits.com/blog/making-internal-reconnaissance-harder-using-netcease-and-samri1o/) against this type of reconnaissance by changing a Windows registry key to only allow administrators to perform remote SAM queries since, by default, all authenticated domain users can make these queries to gather a considerable amount of information about the AD domain. |

# NTLM Authentication
Aside from Kerberos and LDAP, Active Directory uses several other authentication methods which can be used (and abused) by applications and services in AD.
These include LM, NTLM, NTLMv1, and NTLMv2. 
LM and NTLM here are the hash names, and NTLMv1 and NTLMv2 are authentication protocols that utilize the LM or NT hash.
Below is a quick comparison between these hashes and protocols, which shows us that, while not perfect by any means, Kerberos is often the authentication protocol of choice wherever possible. 
It is essential to understand the difference between the hash types and the protocols that use them

## Hash Protocol Comparison

|**Hash/Protocol**|**Cryptographic technique**|**Mutual Authentication**|**Message Type**|**Trusted Third Party**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|`NTLM`|Symmetric key cryptography|No|Random number|Domain Controller|
|`NTLMv1`|Symmetric key cryptography|No|MD4 hash, random number|Domain Controller|
|`NTLMv2`|Symmetric key cryptography|No|MD4 hash, random number|Domain Controller|
|`Kerberos`|Symmetric key cryptography & asymmetric cryptography|Yes|Encrypted ticket using DES, MD5|Domain Controller/Key Distribution Center (KDC)|
## LM

`LAN Manager` (LM or LANMAN) hashes are the oldest password storage mechanism used by the Windows operating system.
LM debuted in 1987 on the OS/2 operating system. If in use, they are stored in the SAM database on a Windows host and the NTDS.DIT database on a Domain Controller.
**Due to significant security weaknesses in the hashing algorithm used for LM hashes**, it has been turned off by default since Windows Vista/Server 2008. However, it is still common to encounter, especially in large environments where older systems are still used.
Passwords using LM are limited to a maximum of `14` characters. *Passwords are not case sensitive and are converted to uppercase before generating the hashed value*, limiting the keyspace to a total of *69 characters* making it relatively easy to crack these hashes using a tool such as Hashcat.

Before hashing, a 14 character password is first split into two seven-character chunks. If the password is less than fourteen characters, it will be padded with NULL characters to reach the correct value. Two DES keys are created from each chunk. These chunks are then encrypted using the string `KGS!@#$%`, creating two 8-byte ciphertext values. These two values are then concatenated together, resulting in an LM hash. *This hashing algorithm means that an attacker only needs to brute force seven characters twice instead of the entire fourteen characters*, making it fast to crack LM hashes on a system with one or more GPUs.
If a password is seven characters or less, the second half of the LM hash will always be the same value and could even be determined visually without even needed tools such as Hashcat. The use of LM hashes can be disallowed using [Group Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/network-security-do-not-store-lan-manager-hash-value-on-next-password-change). An LM hash takes the form of `299bd128c1101fd6`.

> NOTE
> 
>Windows operating systems prior to Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 (Windows NT4, Windows 2000, Windows 2003, Windows XP) stored both the LM hash and the NTLM hash of a user's password by default.




## NTHash (NTLM)
`NT LAN Manager` (NTLM) hashes are used on modern Windows systems. It is a challenge-response authentication protocol and uses three messages to authenticate: a client first sends a `NEGOTIATE_MESSAGE` to the server, whose response is a `CHALLENGE_MESSAGE` to verify the client's identity. Lastly, the client responds with an `AUTHENTICATE_MESSAGE`. These hashes are stored locally in the SAM database or the NTDS.DIT database file on a Domain Controller. 

The protocol has two hashed password values to choose from to perform authentication: the *LM hash* (as discussed above) and the *NT hash*, which is the MD4 hash of the little-endian UTF-16 value of the password. The algorithm can be visualized as: `MD4(UTF-16-LE(password))`.
### NTLM Authentication Request

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/74/ntlm_auth.png)

*Even though they are considerably stronger than LM hashes (supporting the entire Unicode character set of 65,536 characters), they can still be brute-forced offline relatively quickly using a tool such as Hashcat*. 
GPU attacks have shown that the entire NTLM 8 character keyspace can be brute-forced in under `3 hours`. 
Longer NTLM hashes can be more challenging to crack depending on the password chosen, and even long passwords (15+ characters) can be cracked using an offline dictionary attack combined with rules. 
*NTLM is also vulnerable to the pass-the-hash attack*, which means an attacker can use just the NTLM hash (after obtaining via another successful attack) to authenticate to target systems where the user is a local admin without needing to know the cleartext value of the password.

An NT hash takes the form of `b4b9b02e6f09a9bd760f388b67351e2b`, which is the second half of the full NTLM hash. An NTLM hash looks like this:

```shell-session
Rachel:500:aad3c435b514a4eeaad3b935b51304fe:e46b9e548fa0d122de7f59fb6d48eaa2:::
```

looking the hash above we can break the NTLM hash down in its individual part

- `Rachel`: is the username
- `500`: is Relative Identifier (RID). `500` is the know RID for `administrator`
- `aad3c435b514a4eeaad3b935b51304fe`: is the LM hash, if LM hash are disable on the system can not be user for anything.
- `e46b9e548fa0d122de7f59fb6d48eaa2`: is the NT hash. This can either be cracked offline to reveal the cleartext value or used for pass-hash-attack with tool such [CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec):
```shell-session
BusySec@htb[/htb]$ crackmapexec smb 10.129.41.19 -u rachel -H e46b9e548fa0d122de7f59fb6d48eaa2

SMB         10.129.43.9     445    DC01      [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 (name:DC01) (domain:INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)
SMB         10.129.43.9     445    DC01      [+] INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\rachel:e46b9e548fa0d122de7f59fb6d48eaa2 (Pwn3d!)
```


## NTLMv1 (Net-NTLMv1)
The NTLM protocol performs a challenge/response between a server and client using the NT hash. NTLMv1 uses both the NT and the LM hash, which can make it easier to "crack" offline after capturing a hash using a tool such as [Responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder) or via an [NTLM relay attack](https://byt3bl33d3r.github.io/practical-guide-to-ntlm-relaying-in-2017-aka-getting-a-foothold-in-under-5-minutes.html). 

The protocol is used for network authentication, and the Net-NTLMv1 hash itself is created from a challenge/response algorithm. The server sends the client an 8-byte random number (challenge), and the client returns a 24-byte response. These hashes can NOT be used for pass-the-hash attacks. The algorithm looks as follows:

#### V1 Challenge & Response Algorithm

```shell-session
C = 8-byte server challenge, random
K1 | K2 | K3 = LM/NT-hash | 5-bytes-0
response = DES(K1,C) | DES(K2,C) | DES(K3,C)
```
#### NTLMv1 Hash Example

```shell-session
u4-netntlm::kNS:338d08f8e26de93300000000000000000000000000000000:9526fb8c23a90751cdd619b6cea564742e1e4bf33006ba41:cb8086049ec4736c
```
NTLMv1 was the building block for modern NTLM authentication. Like any protocol, it has flaws and is susceptible to cracking and other attacks. 

## NTLMv2 (Net-NTLMv2)

The NTLMv2 protocol was first introduced in Windows NT 4.0 SP4 and was created as a stronger alternative to NTLMv1.
It has been the default in Windows since Server 2000. It is hardened against certain spoofing attacks that NTLMv1 is susceptible to. 
NTLMv2 sends two responses to the 8-byte challenge received by the server. These responses contain a 16-byte HMAC-MD5 hash of the challenge, a randomly generated challenge from the client, and an HMAC-MD5 hash of the user's credentials. A second response is sent, using a variable-length client challenge including the current time, an 8-byte random value, and the domain name. 
The algorithm is as follows:
#### 2 Challenge & Response Algorithm

```shell-session
SC = 8-byte server challenge, random
CC = 8-byte client challenge, random
CC* = (X, time, CC2, domain name)
v2-Hash = HMAC-MD5(NT-Hash, user name, domain name)
LMv2 = HMAC-MD5(v2-Hash, SC, CC)
NTv2 = HMAC-MD5(v2-Hash, SC, CC*)
response = LMv2 | CC | NTv2 | CC*
```

An example of an NTLMv2 hash is:

#### NTLMv2 Hash Example

```shell-session
admin::N46iSNekpT:08ca45b7d7ea58ee:88dcbe4446168966a153a0064958dac6:5c7830315c7830310000000000000b45c67103d07d7b95acd12ffa11230e0000000052920b85f78d013c31cdb3b92f5d765c783030
```

We can see that developers improved upon v1 by making NTLMv2 harder to crack and giving it a more robust algorithm made up of multiple stages.
We have one more authentication mechanism to discuss before moving on. This method is of note to us because it does not require a persistent network connection to work.

## Domain Cached Credentials (MSCache2)

In an AD environment, the authentication methods mentioned in this section and the previous require the host we are trying to access to communicate with the "brains" of the network, the Domain Controller. 
Microsoft developed the [MS Cache v1 and v2](https://webstersprodigy.net/2014/02/03/mscash-hash-primer-for-pentesters/) algorithm (also known as `Domain Cached Credentials` (DCC) to solve the potential issue of a domain-joined host being unable to communicate with a domain controller (i.e., due to a network outage or other technical issue) and, hence, NTLM/Kerberos authentication not working to access the host in question. 

Hosts save the last `ten` hashes for any domain users that successfully log into the machine in the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY\Cache` registry key.
These hashes *cannot be used in pass-the-hash attacks*. Furthermore, the hash is very slow to crack with a tool such as Hashcat, even when using an extremely powerful GPU cracking rig, so attempts to crack these hashes typically need to be extremely targeted or rely on a very weak password in use. 
These hashes can be obtained by an attacker or pentester after gaining local admin access to a host and have the following format: `$DCC2$10240#bjones#e4e938d12fe5974dc42a90120bd9c90f`. 

It is vital as penetration testers that we understand the varying types of hashes that we may encounter while assessing an AD environment, their strengths, weaknesses, how they can be abused (cracking to cleartext, pass-the-hash, or relayed), and when an attack may be futile (i.e., spending days attempting to crack a set of Domain Cached Credentials).
