# What is a Network?
A network is a **set of  hardware devices connect together** either physically or logically. This allow them to exchange information or communicate.

# Path used to carry data on the network

## Circuit Switching
In the **circuit-switching** networking method a connection called **circuit** when is used for **whole** communication, is set up between two devices. 

In circuit-switching before communication can occur a circuit (a path from A to B) is established and never change until the communication ended.

This type of network connection is used in **telephone system**.

## Packet Switching 
In the **packet-switching** network type instance no **specific path is used to transfer**.
In this case the data will be **chopped** up into small pieces called **packets** and sent over the network and they will be take **any number of paths** as the journey from one device to another. Nothing **circuit** will be set here.

# Connection-Oriented and Connectionless

A **conncetion-orented** protocol is one in which a **logical connection is first established**. ( For example a **TCP** protocol).
A **Connectionless** protocol the **data is just sent without a connection begin created**. ( For exmaple a **UDP** protocol).
