# What is a Network?
A network is a set of  hardware devices connect together either physically or logically. This allow theme to exchange information or comunicate.

# Path used to carry data on the network


## Circuit Switching
In the **circuit-switching** networking method a connection called **circuit** which is used for **whole** communication, is set up between two devices. 

In circuit-switching before communication can occur a circuite (a path from A to B) is established and never change untile the communication ended.

This type of network connection is used in **telephone system**.


## Packet Switching 
In the packet-switching network type instance no specific path is used to transfer.
In this case the data will be chopped up into small pieces called **packets** and sent over the network and they will be take **any number of paths** as the journey from one device to another. Nothing **circuit** will be set here.

# Connection-Oriented and Connectionless

A conncetion-orented protocol is one in which a **logical connection is first established**. ( For example a **TCP** protocol).
Instance a Connectionless protocol the **data is just sent without a connection begin created**. ( For exmple a **UDP** protocol).
